# Optional - The name for workflow runs generated from the workflow, which will appear in the list of workflow runs on your repository's "Actions" tab. 
# This example uses an expression with the github context to display the username of the actor that triggered the workflow run.

# Specifies the trigger for this workflow. This example uses the push event, so a workflow run is triggered every time someone pushes a change to the repository or merges a pull request. 
# This is triggered by a push to every branch;
on: [push]

# A job is a set of steps in a workflow that is executed on the same runner. 
# Each step is either a shell script that will be executed, or an action that will be run. 
# Steps are executed in order and are dependent on each other. 
# Since each step is executed on the same runner, you can share data from one step to another.

  # Defines a job named check-bats-version. The child keys will define properties of the job.  
  check-bats-version:

    # Configures the job to run on the latest version of an Ubuntu Linux runner. 
    # This means that the job will execute on a fresh virtual machine hosted by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Groups together all the steps that run in the check-bats-version job. 
    # Each item nested under this section is a separate action or shell script.
    steps:

        # The uses keyword specifies that this step will run v4 of the actions/checkout action. 
        # This is an action that checks out your repository onto the runner, allowing you to run scripts or other actions against your code (such as build and test tools). 
        # You should use the checkout action any time your workflow will use the repository's code.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

        # This step uses the actions/setup-node@v3 action to install the specified version of the Node.js. 
        # (This example uses version 14.) This puts both the node and npm commands in your PATH.
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '14'
     
        # The run keyword tells the job to execute a command on the runner. In this case, you are using npm to install the bats software testing package.
      - run: npm install -g bats
      
        # Finally, you'll run the bats command with a parameter that outputs the software version.
      - run: bats -v
